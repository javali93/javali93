### Hi, I'm Chetana 👋🏼👩🏻‍💻


I’m a firm believer in learning new things to gain a broader perspective and finding efficient solutions to challenges. I have 5 years of experience as a software engineer.

I’m currently working as a backend developer for California based startup - TrueLark - a next-generation AI-powered customer help-desk for local businesses via messaging and voice.

I’m always enthusiastic about solving new challenges through technological innovations.
